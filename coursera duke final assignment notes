1. We may want to consider Linear regression (to predict value) to predict the energy output. 
The features are AT, AP, RH and V ... or a combination of those features, perhaps eliminating Temperature to see how it impacts the model.
Logistic Regression algorithms is not a good fit because we are not trying to predict a category. Decision Tree or Random Forest, same, and overcomplicated. 


2. The output metric to evaluate is the accuracy level (with help from scikit/python "test score") in predicting the Net hourly electrical energy output (PE) fom the model.

3. data is split for training and testing 

4. comparing at least two different models (same algorithm, different combo of features)






Modeling approach - did you correctly identify the type of modeling task, features to use, and possible algorithms to use?

Model building  - did you compare at least two different models (different algorithms, different combinations of features, or different hyperparameter combinations) using a vlidation set or cross-validation to optimize your model?

Model evaluation - did you set a reasonable evaluation metric to determine the performance of your model, and then calculate it on the test set?

Model interpretation - did you correctly interpret and clearly communicate the performance of your model?
